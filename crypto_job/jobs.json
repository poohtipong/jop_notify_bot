After every single buy, the price increases, ensuring every user sells at a profit. Suggest which functions I should add to achieve this. The smart contract should be developed and deployed on either Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or Polygon, depending on which is more suitable for performance and low transaction fees.\nWe will handle the deployment and liquidity addition, but we need your step-by-step support preferably via AnyDesk to ensure everything is executed correctly, including deploying the contract and adding liquidity on Uniswap. It‚Äôs essential that the coin works flawlessly and that the price spikes significantly with each transaction.\nIf you have proven experience creating custom smart contracts and launching tokens on DEX platforms, we‚Äôd love to work with you.",
