We wish to add support for subscriptions to the app, mirroring the subscriptions we provide for the same app on IOS.  We are experienced developers and can handle all aspects ofQtuser interface.\n\nWe require a C++ module/library for interfacing with Google Play subscriptions and a sample app that demonstrates the functionality.  The module will interface with Java API's for purchasing, cancelling, querying status of user subscriptions.  The API will be general purpose in nature, although it may not need to handle aspects of Google Play subscriptions not required by our app.  The module will be 100% independent of our software.  We will likely choose to release the module as open-source.\n\nWe will use the C++ API to interface our app with Google Play store.  We will require guidance and help in packaging C++/Java code you write into our APK and related resources so the combined software can be successfully submitted to the Google play store for publication.\n\nThe successful developer will:\n* Be familiar Google Play subscriptions\n* Knowledgeable about interfacing C++/Qt/Java software\n* Able to write robust, clean, readable, documented C++/Java code.\n* Able to design a suitable general purpose C++ subscription API\n* Familiar with packaging of Android apps for submission to the store\n* Knowledgable about Google Play sand-boxing for validating our app.\n* Communicate in English with experienced developers and assist with integration process.\n\nRequirements\n* Support a handful of monthly and annual subscriptions options.\n* Allow discovery of subscription naming & pricing, allowing changes on the Play store to be reflected in our app.\n* Make use of Google Play sandboxing so that the subscriptions may be validated prior to publication\n\nThe steps we plan to follow:\n* Review our existing IOS app and subscriptions\n* Propose a suitable C++ API.\n* We will review and approve this API\n* Implement C++ module and example app.\n* We will validate this app and review the software.\n* Assist with any questions during our integration\n* Assist with any submission of our app to Google Play store",

    "title": "Python Desktop App Developer ‚Äì Build GUI Around AI Model (PDF Symbol Detection)",
    "content": "Here‚Äôs what I need:\nI have a trained AI model that detects electrical symbols in construction drawings (PDF format). The model is already working and detects most symbols with around 75‚Äì90% accuracy. It also needs to give a quantity per symbol for example D1 Light Fitting ‚Äì 283 \n________________________________________\nGoal (Phase 1 ‚Äì Desktop App):\nI want to turn this into a Windows desktop application that I can use on my local PC. I have a GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, so the app should use CUDA acceleration for fast detection.\nThis version is for internal use only so I can:\n‚Ä¢\tTest the AI model on real drawings\n‚Ä¢\tManually correct AI mistakes (missed or mislabeled symbols)\n‚Ä¢\tStress test the full workflow\n‚Ä¢\tLog every correction made, so the model can be retrained later with better data on a continuous basis. (If you have any ideas in regards to making the model more accurate or logging of changes ill be making manually, please let me know)\n________________________________________\nWhat the app should do:\n1.\tLet me drag and drop PDF drawings into the program\n2.\tAutomatically run the AI model on the drawing\n3.\tShow me the PDF with bounding boxes over detected symbols in different colours for each symbol.\n4.\tAllow me to:\no\tDelete wrong detections\no\tAdd missing symbols manually\no\tChange labels of symbols that were mislabeled\no\tWhen doing all of the above it automatically changes the quantitys of each symbol.\n5.\tShow a live count of each symbol type\n6.\tExport:\no\tA marked-up PDF\no\tA CSV or Excel file with total counts for each fitting and a small picture of the symbol.\n7.\tMOST IMPORTANT:\nEvery time I make a correction, I want the app to automatically save a log (e.g. corrections.csv or .json) that includes:\no\tDrawing name\no\tPage number\no\tSymbol type\no\tCoordinates (x, y, width, height)\no\tThe correction type (added / deleted / relabeled)\nThis file will be used by my AI developer to retrain and fine-tune the model based on my edits, or if you can do the following im happy to use you. Please let  me know if you can or cant.\n________________________________________\nPhase 2 ‚Äì Cloud SaaS Platform (After Testing):\nOnce this desktop version is working well and the model is accurate, I plan to turn it into a cloud-based web platform that customers can use. If this goes well, I'd like to work with you long-term on that too. Although if you can only do phase 1 please let me know as I‚Äôm happy with that also.\n________________________________________\nTech Requirements:\n‚Ä¢\tMust run locally on Windows (standalone .exe)\n‚Ä¢\tMust use CUDA (GPU support) for fast AI inference (RTX 4070)\n‚Ä¢\tGUI can be in PyQt5, PySide2, or Tkinter\n‚Ä¢\tUse fitz (PyMuPDF) or similar to render PDFs with overlays\n‚Ä¢\tPackaged cleanly using PyInstaller or similar\n‚Ä¢\tThis desktop program you will be creating does not have to look sleek or clean it needs to just do what I explained above as this is just a program so I can stress test the model with multiple drawings and then make the model as accurate as possible.\n________________________________________\nNext Steps:\nPlease send:\n‚Ä¢\tExamples of similar tools you've built (desktop apps, AI interfaces, etc.)\n‚Ä¢\tYour estimated timeline and fixed price (preferred)\n\nThanks,",
